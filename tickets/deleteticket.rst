Deleting a Ticket
*****************

There are a few reasons that you might wish to delete a ticket. For example, if
you scan a loose tag to make sure it did not get separated from a repair, and it
brings you to the create ticket screen, you probably will wish to delete the
ticket, and return the tag to your stock of empty tickets.

Please keep in mind that a ticket should NOT be deleted after work was completed
on it, and a customer has picked up their item. When a repair is picked up, the
ticket is archived, to allow you to build a repair history over time.

The ‘Delete Ticket’ button will instead DELETE the ticket forever, and remove
it from your repair history.
