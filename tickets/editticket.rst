You will be able to add more of the same repair, change the price, or delete
the repair from the ticket. The price is set per repair, so if you want to add
3 of the same repair to a ticket, and they each will cost $15.00, the price
will be set to $15.00. The app will calculate the subtotal for you.

Tap on 'Save Changes', or to remove a repair, tap on 'Delete Repair'.

 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!

To delete a photo, tap on the little red 'x'. You will be asked to confirm the
