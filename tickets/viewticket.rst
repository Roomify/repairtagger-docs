View Ticket
###########

To work on a ticket, start by scanning the tag. See: :ref:`scan` for
instructions.

When you scan a tag number with an existing ticket, you are taken to the View ticket
page for the ticket with that tag number.

.. note:: If a ticket was created without adding a customer and/or repairs, it
  is considered incomplete. When you scan the tag number for that ticket, you
  will be taken to the edit ticket page instead of the view ticket page, so that
  you can add a customer and repairs. See :ref:`editticket` for help.

The View ticket page has the following possible components:

`Ticket Status bar`_

`Ticket Repair(s)`_

`Ticket Notes`_

`Ticket Photos`_

*****************
Ticket Status bar
*****************

Date/Status
-----------

The Calendar icon shows the current status of the ticket, and the Month/Date
that the ticket was put in that status. In this example, the Status is
'Notified', and the date is Oct 9. This means that the customer was notified on
Oct 9th.

Tapping on the status icon will show you the full status description in
a small window. Tap outside of the window to close it.

Customer
--------

The customer icon shows the last name of the customer. Tapping on the customer
icon will take you to the customer status page  for that customer.

See :ref:`customerstatus` for more details.

Rack #
------

The rack number is generated from the last digit of the tag, and will be a
number from 0-9. Tapping on the rack icon will show the full tag number in the
expanded section.

Actions
-------

The actions menu contains any relevant links for the ticket. Possible links are:
  Edit Details:
    Tap on this link to edit the details of the ticket. Once a ticket is
    archived, this link will no longer be available, as archived tickets cannot
    be edited.

  Send Notification:
    This link will be shown on tickets that are in the 'Not Notified' status.
    This means that all repairs for the ticket have been completed, but the
    customer has not yet been notified. Tapping on the 'Send Notification'
    link will bring up the notification options for the ticket.

  Picked Up:
    This link will be shown on tickets that are in the 'Notified' status. Tap on
    this link to bring up the Picked Up window for the ticket.


****************
Ticket Repair(s)
****************

Each repair type on the ticket will be shown with a checkbox when viewing the
ticket. When a repair is complete, tap on the checkbox, and it will be marked as
done. If you tap it by mistake, simply tap again, it will be unchecked. When all
of the repairs on the ticket are marked as complete, the notifications options
will appear. See: :ref:`notifications` for more details.

************
Ticket Notes

If the ticket has notes on it, they will be shown here.

*************

If the ticket has photos, they will be shown here. You can add more photos
without editing the ticket.  Just tap on the 'add image' icon.

IMAGE of image icon on ticket view page

Your device camera will open. Click the shutter button to take a picture. If
you are happy with the image, click on 'Use Photo', otherwise click on 'Retake'

another image can be taken. Thumbnails will appear to the right of the icon.

 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!
