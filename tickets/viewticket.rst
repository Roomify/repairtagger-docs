To work on a ticket, start by scanning the tag. When you scan the tag of an existing ticket, you will be taken to the View ticket screen.
Ticket Status bar
Date/Status
The Calendar icon shows the current status of the ticket, and the Month/Date that the ticket was put in that status. In this example, the Status is ‘Notified’, and the date is Oct 9. This means that the customer was notified, either automatically via Repairtagger, or manually via phone, on Oct 9th. Tapping on the status icon will show you the full status description in the expanded section.
Customer
The customer icon shows the last name of the customer. Tapping on the customer icon will show you the customer details, and a link to view the customer’s other open tickets, if they have any.
Expanded Section
Clicking on the email will open your the email application on your device, with the customer’s email prefilled.
Clicking on the phone, if using a smart phone (and not a tablet) will ask you if you wish to call that number.
Rack #
The rack number is generated from the last digit of the tag, and will be a number from 0-9. Tapping on the rack icon will show the full tag number in the expanded section.
Actions
The actions menu contains any relevant links for the ticket. Possible links are:
Edit Details: Open tickets will have a link in the Actions menu to edit the details of the ticket. Once a ticket is archived, this link will no longer be available, as archived tickets cannot be edited.
Send Notification: This link will be shown on tickets that are in the ‘Not Notified’ status. This means that all repairs for the ticket have been completed, but the customer has not yet been notified. Clicking on the ‘Send Notification’ link will bring up the notification options for the ticket.
Complete repair work
This one is all you!
(Optional) Add Notes/Image(s)
If you wish to update the ticket with notes or images of the completed repair, edit the ticket. See: Editing a ticket - Making changes after intake
Mark repair(s) complete
Each repair type on the ticket will be shown with a checkbox when viewing the ticket. When a repair is complete, tap on the checkbox, and it will be marked as done. If you tap it by mistake, simply tap again, it will be unchecked. When all repairs on the ticket are marked as complete, the notifications options will appear. See: Notifications
