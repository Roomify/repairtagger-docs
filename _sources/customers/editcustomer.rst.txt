Step by step instructions:

1. Tap on the 'customer' icon in the footer. This will take you to the customer
   list.
2. Find the customer by searching for them in the list. See: :doc:`customerlist`
   for help.
3. Tap on the customer name to go to their status page.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap on 'Edit Customer'.

Once you have loaded the edit page for the customer you wish to update, simply
tap on any of the customer fields (First name, last name, email, phone number,
Text, or notes) to edit.

Phone numbers
-------------

Repairtagger accommodates international phone numbers for customers. By default,
a new customer will have the country code set to the shop country (or to US,
if no shop country is set).  This can be changed - simply tap on the
flag for the phone number you wish to enter and the country selection will open. 
Start typing the name of the country you wish to set, and tap on it when it
appears in the list.  It will look like this:

Once you have changed the country, the phone number will be correctly formatted
as you type.  Be aware that phone numbers are validated when a customer is
saved, so if you are trying this functionality out, you will have to use a valid
phone number for the country and type.  For example, a valid UK Mobile number
will start with 077, 078, or 079.

Photos
------

If you wish to add photos to this customer, tap on the 'add image' icon. Your
device camera will open. Click the shutter button to take a picture. If
you are happy with the image, click on 'Use Photo', otherwise click on 'Retake'
to retake the picture. The 'add image' will be replaced with the thumbnail while
the image uploads.

As soon as the upload is complete, the 'add image' icon will be shown again, and
another image can be taken. Thumbnails will appear to the right of the icon.

.. note:: Photos will occasionally take a little while to upload to the server.
 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!

When you have finished making your changes, tap on ‘Save Customer’. Your
changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the customer status page.
If you change your mind about the edits you made, and wish to discard them,
simply tap on 'Cancel' in the top left corner of the page. You will be
returned to the customer status page, and the customer's information will not
be changed.
