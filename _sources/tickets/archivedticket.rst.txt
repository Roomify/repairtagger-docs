Archived Tickets
################

When a ticket is complete, and the item has been picked up, the ticket is
archived.  The tag number is removed from the ticket and can now be used again
for a new ticket, if desired.  The ticket can no longer be edited, but the
information is available for later reference.

To find a customer's archived ticket, tap on the 'Archived Tickets' link on
thier status page.  See :ref:`customerlist` for help with finding a customer.

An Archived ticket page has the following possible components:

`Archived Ticket Status bar`_

`Ticket Repair(s)`_

`Ticket Notes`_

`Ticket Photos`_

`Archived Tag Number`_

.. include:: ../_static/components/archivedstatusbar.rst

****************
Ticket Repair(s)
****************

Each repair type on the ticket will be shown with a checkbox when viewing the
ticket. When a repair is complete, tap on the checkbox, and it will be marked as
done. If you tap it by mistake, simply tap again, it will be unchecked. When all
of the repairs on the ticket are marked as complete, the notifications options
will appear. See: :ref:`notifications` for more details.

without editing the ticket.  Just tap on the 'add image' icon.

Your device camera will open. Click the shutter button to take a picture. If
you are happy with the image, click on 'Use Photo', otherwise click on 'Retake'
to retake the picture. The 'add image' will be replaced with the thumbnail while
the image uploads.

As soon as the upload is complete, the 'add image' icon will be shown again, and
another image can be taken. Thumbnails will appear to the right of the icon.

.. note:: Photos will occasionally take a little while to upload to the server.
 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!

********************
 Archived Tag Number
********************

When a ticket is archived, Repairtagger removes the tag number from the ticket,
and saves it as the archived tag number.  It will look like this:

If an archived ticket does not have an Archived Tag Number, it is because it
was archived before we added the functionality to store the tag number.  Any
newly archived tickets should have the tag number.
