Physical Tag Options
####################

Repairtagger requires the use of physical tags that will link the item to be
repaired to the ticket in the app using a tag number.

As an example, if you were a Shoe Repair shop and a customer brought in a pair
of shoes to be repaired, you would:

1. scan a tag to create a ticket

2. enter all the ticket information (such as customer, repairs the shoes need,
   etc.)

3. attach the tag you scanned to the pair of shoes

Now anytime you scan the tag attached to the pair of shoes, you can access all
of the information associated with that repair.

There are a number of options available for physical tags that can be used with
Repairtagger.  You can use paper tags, stickers, reusable tags with numbers,
reusable tags with barcodes, or you can even write a number on a piece of paper
in a pinch!

`Single Use tags - Paper`_

`Reusable tags - Numbered`_

`Reusable tags - QR Codes`_

`Reusable tags - Barcodes`_

`Coming Soon - Printed tags!`_

***********************
Single Use tags - Paper
***********************

If you already use numbered paper tags in your shop, you can continue to use
them with Repairtagger. The only restriction is that a tag number can only be
in use on one ticket at a time.

Some examples of paper tags that would work well with Repairtagger are:

`ULine <https://www.uline.com/Product/ProductDetailRootItem?modelnumber=S-7220>`_

You could even use numbered stickers like these!
