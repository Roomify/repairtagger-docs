Physical Tag Options
####################

Repairtagger requires the use of physical tags that will link the item to be
repaired to the ticket in the app using a tag number.

As an example, if you were a Shoe Repair shop and a customer brought in a pair
of shoes to be repaired, you would:

1. scan a tag to create a ticket

2. enter all the ticket information (such as customer, repairs the shoes need,
   etc.)

3. attach the tag you scanned to the pair of shoes

Now anytime you scan the tag attached to the pair of shoes, you can access all
of the information associated with that repair.

There are a number of options available for physical tags that can be used with
Repairtagger.  You can use paper tags, stickers, reusable tags with numbers,
reusable tags with barcodes, or you can even write a number on a piece of paper
in a pinch!

`Single Use tags - Paper`_

`Reusable tags - Numbered`_

`Reusable tags - QR Codes`_

`Reusable tags - Barcodes`_

`Coming Soon - Printed tags!`_

***********************
Single Use tags - Paper
***********************

If you already use numbered paper tags in your shop, you can continue to use
them with Repairtagger. The only restriction is that a tag number can only be
in use on one ticket at a time.

Some examples of paper tags that would work well with Repairtagger are:

`XPresstags <https://www.xpresstags.com/manila-repair-tags/tag-with-stub-and-strings/sku-t368-s>`_

`ULine <https://www.uline.com/Product/ProductDetailRootItem?modelnumber=S-7220>`_

You could even use numbered stickers like these!

Reusable tags - QR Codes
************************

Repairtagger was originally built to use Repairtagger provided tags, with QR
codes. In order to make the app as affordable and as simple to get started with
as possible, tags are no longer provided through Repairtagger.  If you are
interested in using QR codes with the app, see :ref:`qrtagdesign` for
instructions on how to design and order your own branded QR tags.

.. note:: A Bluetooth scanner capable of scanning QR codes can be used with
 Repairtagger.  See the `Reusable tags - Barcodes`_ section for more details.

.. warning:: A Bluetooth scanner that is connected to your device is required to
 be able to scan Barcodes into Repairtagger. A known compatible device can be
 found here: `Bluetooth Scanner <https://www.amazon.com/NETUM-Bluetooth-Handheld-Wireless-NT-1228BL/dp/B07CBS52KJ>`_

.. note:: Most devices consider scanners to be a bluetooth keyboard, and this
 can prevent the device keyboard from coming up while the scanner is connected.
 This can be an issue on Android devices, but there is a setting to change this:
 Settings -> general management -> language and input -> physical keyboard -> show onscreen keyboard
