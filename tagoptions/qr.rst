Tags with QR Codes
******************

Repairtagger can be used with tags with QR codes on them. A QR code is an
image that contains information.

Line up the qr code on the tag in the camera frame.
Once the code is successfully read, you will see a ‘Loading Tag’ message and
you will be taken to the existing ticket.
If the tag number is not in use, a new ticket will be created.
(See :ref:`intake` )
Type a tag number in manually
