To search for a customer, start typing a first name, last name, or phone number.
The list will be filtered down to matching customers as you type. When you see
the customer you are looking for, tap on their name to open the Customer status
page. See: :doc:`customerstatus` for more details.

Customers with open tickets will have a tag icon next to their name.  If they
have more than one open ticket, the number will be shown in the tag icon.
