Customer List
*************
* The customer list can be accessed at any time by tapping on the people icon in the footer menu.
* The search bar in this list works in the same way that it does when adding a customer to a ticket. Start typing a first name or last name and the list will be filtered down to matching customers as you type. When you see the customer you are looking for, tap on their name to open the Customer status page.
* The number of open tickets (not archived) that a customer has will be shown next to their name.
