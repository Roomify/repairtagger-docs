Edit Customer
#############

You can edit existing customers by tapping on the ‘Edit Customer’ button on
their customer status page.

Step by step instructions:

1. Tap on the 'customer' icon in the footer. This will take you to the customer
   list.
2. Find the customer by searching for them in the list. See: :doc:`customerlist`
   for help.
3. Tap on the customer name to go to their status page.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap on 'Edit Customer'.

Once you have loaded the edit page for the customer you wish to update, simply
tap on any of the customer fields (First name, last name, email, phone number,
Text, or notes) to edit. If you wish to add photos to this customer, tap on the
'add image' icon.

Your device camera will open. Click the shutter button to take a picture. If
you are happy with the image, click on 'Use Photo', otherwise click on 'Retake'
to retake the picture. The 'add image' will be replaced with the thumbnail while
the image uploads.

As soon as the upload is complete, the 'add image' icon will be shown again, and
another image can be taken. Thumbnails will appear to the right of the icon.

.. note:: Photos will occasionally take a little while to upload to the server.
 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!

When you have finished making your changes, tap on ‘Save Customer’. Your
changes will be saved, and you will be returned to the customer status page.
If you change your mind about the edits you made, and wish to discard them,
simply tap on 'Cancel' in the top left corner of the page. You will be
returned to the customer status page, and the customer's information will not
be changed.
