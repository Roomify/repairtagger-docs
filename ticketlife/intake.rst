Step 2: Add the ticket information
##################################

When you scan an unused tag number, a new ticket is created.
(As seen in :doc:`scantag`)

The next step is to add the ticket information. Adding a customer and repairs
to the ticket is required. Notes and photos can also be added, but these are
optional!

*****************
1. Add a Customer
*****************

The first step in adding information to a ticket is adding a customer. You will
see a Search by Phone field.

IMAGE (phone search field)

Start typing in the customer's phone number. If they are in the system already,
you will see their name in the search results.

IMAGE (search results)

Tap on their name to add them to the ticket.

If you prefer, you can search for a customer by name or email.

IMAGE

Tap on 'Search by name/email instead' and start typing the customer's first
name, last name, or email. If they are in the system already, you will see their
name in the search results. Tap on their name to add them to the ticket.

Adding a New Customer
---------------------

If this customer has not yet been entered in Repairtagger, you can easily add
them now. Tap on the 'Add Customer' icon.

IMAGE

.. note:: If you tap on this by accident, simply tap 'Cancel' and you will be
 taken back to the search.

You will be shown fields to enter the customer's information. Enter their
details and tap on 'Add this customer'.

IMAGE

The customer will be created and added to the ticket.

.. note:: If you try to save a customer without entering an email address or a
 phone number, you will be shown a message. This message will inform you that
 the Repairtagger app will be unable to use templated notifications for that
 customer, and ask if you sure you want to continue without that information.

 Tap on 'I'll add the info' if you wish to go back and add an email address or a
 phone number for the customer.

 Tap on 'That's Ok' if this customer does not wish
 to be texted or emailed, and will require a phone call for a notification.

**************
2. Add Repairs
**************

When creating or editing a ticket, you will see all of your categories beneath
the customer name.

IMAGE

.. note:: You can add, edit, and re-order your categories and repairs in your
 price list. :ref:`pricelist`

Tap on a category to show its repairs.

IMAGE

Tap on a repair to add it to the ticket.

Repeat the process to add more repairs.

IMAGE

.. note:: If you added a repair by accident, you can remove it in the next step.

**********
3. Invoice
**********

All repairs added to the ticket will be shown in the Invoice section.

IMAGE

The ticket invoice shows how much each repair costs, the subtotal, the amount
paid, and the balance that will be due on pickup, if any. To change the quantity
or price of a repair, tap on the repair in the invoice.

IMAGE

You will be able to add more of the same repair, change the price, or delete
the repair from the ticket. The price is set per repair, so if you want to add
3 of the same repair to a ticket, and they each will cost $15.00, the price
will be set to $15.00. The app will calculate the subtotal for you.

Tap on 'Save Changes'.

If you take payment up front or a deposit, you can indicate how much the
customer has already paid. In the Invoice, tap on 'Paid'

IMAGE

Type in the amount paid. If it is less than the ticket subtotal, the ticket will
be marked as Balance Due. The amount due will be shown when the customer comes
to pick up their item, and the ticket will be shown with a red dollar sign icon.

IMAGE

If the ticket is paid in full, it will be marked as such, and shown with a green
dollar sign icon.

Optional: Add Notes and Photos
******************************

Notes
-----

.. warning:: The notes are the only step of creating a ticket that require you
 to save your work!

The notes section should be used to add any additional information that you need
for the ticket. Tap in the 'Notes' field to start typing. Once you have finished
entering your notes, click on the 'Save Notes' button that appears beneath the
field.

IMAGE

Photos
------

To add a photo to a ticket (for example, if you wish to have a record of the
condition the item was in when it was dropped off), click on the 'add image'
icon.

IMAGE

Your device camera will open. Click the shutter button to take a picture. If
you are happy with the image, click on 'Use Photo', otherwise click on 'Retake'
to retake the picture. The 'add image' will be replaced with the thumbnail while
the image uploads.

As soon as the upload is complete, the 'add image' icon will be shown again, and
another image can be taken. Thumbnails will appear to the right of the icon.

.. note:: Photos will occasionally take a little while to upload to the server.
 Do not worry if you do not see the uploaded photo right away!
