Step 2: Add the ticket information
##################################

When you scan an unused tag number, a new ticket is created.
(As seen in :doc:`scantag`)

The next step is to add the ticket information. Adding a customer and repairs
to the ticket is required. Notes and photos can also be added, but these are
optional!

*********************
First: Add a Customer
*********************

The first step in adding information to a ticket is adding a customer. You will
see a Search by Phone field.

Start typing in the customer's phone number. If they are in the system already,
you will see their name in the search results.

Tap on their name to add them to the ticket.

If you prefer, you can search for a customer by name or email.

Tap on 'Search by name/email instead' and start typing the customer's first
name, last name, or email. If they are in the system already, you will see their
name in the search results. Tap on their name to add them to the ticket.

Adding a New Customer
---------------------

If this customer has not yet been entered in Repairtagger, you can easily add
them now. Tap on the 'Add Customer' icon.

.. note:: If you tap on this by accident, simply tap 'Cancel' and you will be
 taken back to the search.

You will be shown fields to enter the customer's information. Enter their
details and tap on 'Add this customer'.

The customer will be created and added to the ticket.

.. note:: If you save a customer without entering an email address or a phone
 number, you will be shown a message. This message will inform you that the
 Repairtagger app will be unable to use templated notifications for that
 customer, and ask if you sure you want to continue without that information.

 Tap on 'I'll add the info' if you wish to go back and add an email address or a
 phone number for the customer.

 Tap on 'That's Ok' if this customer does not wish
 to be texted or emailed, and will require a phone call for a notification.
