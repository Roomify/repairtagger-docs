Step 1. Scan a tag
##################

The first step in the list of a Repairtagger ticket is to scan a tag number to
create a new ticket. When you scan a tag number that is not yet in use,
a new ticket is automatically created. If a tag number is already in use on a
ticket, the app will open the existing ticket.

If you are wondering where this tag number is supposed to come from, check out
the :ref:`tagoptions`. Repairtagger uses physical tags with a tag number to
connect the item to be repaired to the ticket in the app.

Have a tag ready?
