Interacting with Calendars
--------------------------
These calendars are currently display-only. You cannot interact with the events (that can only happen on the administration side of things); however, by changing the widgets at the code level you can easily make them interactive - Roomify is `available for commercial services or enterprise support around the use of BAT <https://roomify.us/get-started>`_
