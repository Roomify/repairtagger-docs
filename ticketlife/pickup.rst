Step 5: Pick up and Archival
############################

When a customer picks up their repaired item, the ticket should be archived -
this will disassociate the ticket from the tag number, and leave that tag number
free to use for a new ticket. When a customer comes in to pick up their item,
scan the tag number. (See: :doc:`scantag`)

If the ticket has been marked as 'Notified', when you scan the tag number, you
will be shown the Picked Up section.

If there is a balance due on the ticket, it will be shown here.

Collect the remaining balance, and then tap on 'Yes, paid in full'

If the ticket is already paid in full, this will be shown here.

Tap on 'Yes, picked up'.

The ticket will be archived and you are finished!
