The Reports tab provides some quick, at-a-glance information about the state of
tickets in your shop.

************
Open Tickets
************

This number is exactly what it sounds like - the number of open tickets in your
shop.  This number includes tickets that have just been received, tickets that
are being worked on, and tickets that are waiting for pickup. In other words,
all tickets that are not archived.

********
Archived
********

This number tells you how many tickets you have archived in the current month.

******************************
# of Archived Tickets by Month
******************************

This is a simple graph to show how many tickets have been archived over the last
four months. On iOS devices, if you tap on the line, it will show the numbers
for each month.
