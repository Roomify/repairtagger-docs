Customer Repair Status Page
###########################

The Customer Repair Status Page is a way for your customers to check on the
status of a repair themselves!  When you create your shop, a Customer Status
Page is generated.

Your customer can enter their cell phone number, and if it is associated with
any open tickets in your shop, they will be able to see the status of their
repair.

.. TODO update this with a specific example once my.repairtagger.com is up and running
