How to scan a tag
*****************

There are three tabs at the top of the scan page:

Camera Icon

This tab is where you can scan QR codes.

*****************
Scanning QR Codes
*****************

1. Tap on the camera icon tab at the top of the page
2. Position the camera over the QR code.

You will see a ‘Loading Tag’ message when the QR code has been read. If the tag
number is in use, you will be taken to the existing ticket, otherwise a new
ticket will be created.

`Scanning Using a Bluetooth Scanner`_

`Scanning by typing in a number`_

*******************************

1. Tap on the tag icon tab at the top of the page
2. Position the lit box over the tag number.
3. Hold it there until a button appears beneath the camera window with the tag
   number on it.
4. Tap on the button. You will see a ‘Loading Tag’ message. If this tag number
   is in use on a ticket, you will be taken to the ticket.  If it is not in use,

  shown for each number.  Simply tap on the one that you wish to use.

Helpful hints for scanning numbers
----------------------------------

Text recognition is a pretty cool technology, but it is not perfect!  Some
numbers will scan better than others, and there are some limitations in the
technology in general.  Here are some examples of what will scan well, what
scan less well, and some numbers that just aren't going to scan no matter how
much you wiggle your device around.

Numbers that will scan well
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Numbers that are clearly printed, without nearby text, will scan very well.
There are a few exceptions to the rule about nearby text.  They are:

no.

tag #.

tag #

#

number.

number

tag no.

tag no

Here are some examples of tags that are perfectly suited to this application:

 :width: 200

 :width: 200

Handwritten Numbers
+++++++++++++++++++

It is even possible to scan handwritten numbers, if they are carefully written,
and well spaced.  Here are a few examples of handwritten numbers that scan well:

.. image:: /_static/components/images/good-tag5.jpg
 :width: 200

Numbers that will not scan as well
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Numbers that have a lot of closely surrounding text, a strange font, or are
widely spaced will be harder to scan.

Here are some examples of tags that should still scan, but not as well:

.. image:: /_static/components/images/ok-tag1.png
 :width: 200

.. image:: /_static/components/images/ok-tag2.png
 :width: 200

Numbers that probably are not going to scan
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Handwritten numbers that are messy and close together are probably not going to
scan well, if at all.

Here is an example of a number that will not scan:
