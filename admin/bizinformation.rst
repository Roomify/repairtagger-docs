Country

This is where you can set the Country that your shop is in.  It will be set to
your device's country when you create a Repairtagger account, and will default
to the US if no country is detected or otherwise set.

To set or change your shop's country, tap in the box labeled 'Country'. It looks

When you tap in the box, the country selection will open.  Start typing the name
of the country you wish to set, and tap on it when it appears in the list.  It

Then save the Business Information page.  All new customers created will have
the default country code for phone numbers set to the shop country.  If a shop
country is not set, this will default to the US.
