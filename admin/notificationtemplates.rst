This page is where you can update the templates that are used for your text and
email notifications.

Placeholders
************

There are a few placeholders for customer and ticket information that are
available to be used in templates.  These placeholders will be filled with
information pulled from the customer that is being notified, or the ticket that
the notification is sent from.

You can use the following placeholders in your templates:

  **First name:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the first name of the customer being
    notified.

  **Last name:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the last name of the customer being
    notified.

  **Ticket tag number:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the tag number of the ticket that the
    notification is sent from.

To use a placeholder:

When editing a template, look above the keyboard.  The available placeholders
will be shown as buttons.
