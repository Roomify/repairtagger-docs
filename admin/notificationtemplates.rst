the notification is sent from.

You can use the following placeholders in your templates:

  **First name:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the first name of the customer being
    notified.

  **Last name:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the last name of the customer being
    notified.

  **Ticket tag number:**
    This placeholder will be replaced with the tag number of the ticket that the
    notification is sent from.

To use a placeholder:

When editing a template, look above the keyboard.  The available placeholders
will be shown as buttons.
