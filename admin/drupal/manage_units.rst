Once you have:

#. Created Type Bundles - :doc:`type_bundles`
#. Create Event Types - :doc:`events`
#. Connected Events to Type Bundles - :doc:`events_types`
#. Created at least one Type - :doc:`types`

you can now go ahead and actually manage your units!

Visit `admin/bat/unit-management`.

Add or Remove Units
===================

To add the type of units you are interested in, click on "Units" and then "Add Units."

BAT will automatically assign names, based on the unit type, which you can then go in and edit.

You can also delete units by selecting them and using the **Views Bulk Operation** action to delete them.


Manage Unit Events
==================

The links to manage events under the **Calendars** section will only appear if type bundles and event types are connected. Clicking on them will take you to a default **Event Unit Management** view which allows you to manage your events.
