Due Dates
#########

Due dates are available in Repairtagger, but optional.  If your shop either
gives customers an expected pick up date, or sets internal due dates for items,
you can use this functionality to help keep track of them.

To enable due dates, tap on the 'Enable Due Dates' switch at the top of the
page. When this switch is on, you will see all of the settings available to you.

Enabling due dates makes the following changes in the app:

Tickets are given a due date when created.  This can be changed when creating or
editing a ticket. See: :ref:`editticketduedate`

The ticket list is now ordered by Due date, instead of by date received. See:
:ref:`ticketlistorder`

********************
Number of days ahead
********************

This setting controls the default due date that is set when a ticket is created.
(This can be changed on each ticket if you wish) This setting will skip days
that are marked as closed in the 'Open days' section.

*********
Open days
*********

Check the days of a week that your shop is open.  Leave closed days unchecked.
The 'number of days ahead' setting will skip closed days.  For example, if your
default pickup is 5 business days after an item is received, and your shop is
open M-F, an item dropped off on a Tuesday would be due the following Tuesday.
(Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tues)

Enable this switch if you wish to be able to specify a time that an item will be
due.
